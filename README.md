question to chatgpt:
what project could you recommend to make after know fundamentals? 
<pre>
As a language model, I don't have personal experiences or opinions, but here are some projects that can help you reinforce your programming skills and knowledge of the fundamentals:

To-Do List App: Create a simple to-do list app where users can add, edit, and delete items. You can start with a text-based interface and then add a graphical user interface (GUI) later on.

Calculator: Create a calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can start with a basic command-line interface and then move on to a GUI-based calculator.

Weather App: Create an app that shows the weather for a particular location. You can use an API to retrieve the weather data and display it to the user.

Hangman Game: Create a classic hangman game where the player has to guess a word, one letter at a time. If the player makes too many incorrect guesses, the game is over.

Quiz Game: Create a quiz game that asks multiple-choice questions and keeps track of the player's score. You can start with a basic quiz on a specific topic, such as geography or history, and then expand to other topics.

These projects are great ways to reinforce your programming skills and get hands-on experience with various concepts. Feel free to make changes and customize the projects to fit your interests.
